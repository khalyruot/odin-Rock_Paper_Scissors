# odin-Rock_Paper_Scissors

Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game that is often used as a decision-making tool between two people. 
It's played by two participants who simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:
  Rock: A fist.
  Paper: Open hand.
  Scissors: Fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.

The rules are straightforward:
  Rock crushes scissors (rock wins).
  Scissors cuts paper (scissors wins).
  Paper covers rock (paper wins).

We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.
We’re going to play the game from the browser console, and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
