            Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
            
            <ul>Gameplay:
                <li>Both players count to three in unison (either audibly or in their heads).</li>
                <li>On the count of three, each player simultaneously forms one of the three hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors).</li>
                <li>The players reveal their chosen gestures to each other.</li>
                <li>Determine the winner based on the outcomes mentioned earlier: rock, paper, or scissors.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul> Outcomes:
                <li>Player 1 chooses rock, and Player 2 chooses scissors. Player 1 wins.</li>
                <li>Player 1 chooses rock, and Player 2 chooses scissors. Player 1 wins.</li>
                <li>Player 1 chooses scissors, and Player 2 chooses paper. Player 1 wins.</li>
                <li>Player 1 and Player 2 both choose the same gesture (e.g., both choose rock). The game is a tie.</li>
            </ul>
